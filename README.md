I have created an web scraping API to scrape Bestbuy and Amazon given a link to an item or a wishlist (Amazon only). I set up a connection to a postgres database to store this data. I also set up user authentication. However, I took off the database connection for now.

I am currenlty done with this for now and this is a standalone project that has enhanced my webscraping and API development skills. Once I learn enougbh to be able to create a website, I will use this API and add more features for  a compolet Shoping Site Scraper.
