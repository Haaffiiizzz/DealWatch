# Web Scraping API for Amazon and Best Buy

## Description
This project is a web scraping API designed to scrape product details from Amazon and Best Buy. The API supports scraping individual product pages or Amazon wishlists. 

This project has significantly enhanced my skills in web scraping and API development, and integrating LLMs. I am currently working on building the frontend for this using react.
